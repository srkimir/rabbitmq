CONCLUSION message ACKED before CONSUMER received it.
Consumer using noAck: true|false does have nothing to do with publisher confirms.

1. transient (non persistent) message is confirmed (Acked) the moment it is enqueued

2. Persistent message is confirmed when it is persisted to disk or when it is consumed on every queue. Only the first causes a confirm to be sent. Every published message will be confirmed sooner or later and no message will be confirmed more than once.
